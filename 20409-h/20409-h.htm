<h2>NOTES.</h2>

<h3>LORD BACON'S "ADVANCEMENT OF LEARNING."</h3>

  <p>Considering the large number of quotations from previous writers which
  occur in Lord Bacon's works, and especially in his most popular and
  generally read works&mdash;his <i>Essays</i> and his <i>Advancement of
  Learning</i>&mdash;it is remarkable how little his editors have done for
  the illustration of his text in this respect. The French editors of
  Montaigne's <i>Essays</i>, who is likewise a writer abounding in
  quotations, have bestowed much care on this portion of their author's
  text. The defect in question has, however, been to a great extent
  supplied in a recent edition of the <i>Advancement of Learning</i>,
  published by Mr. Parker in West Strand; and it is to be hoped that the
  beginning, so usefully made, may be followed up by similar editions of
  other of Bacon's works.</p>

  <p>The edition in question, though it traces the great majority of
  Bacon's quotations, has left some gleanings to its successors; and I
  propose now to call attention to a few passages of the <i>Advancement of
  Learning</i> which, after the labours of the late editor, seem still to
  require further elucidation. My references are to the pages of the new
  edition:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>P. 25. "Then grew the flowing and watery vein of Osorius the Portugal
  bishop to be in price."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The editor prints <i>Orosius</i> for <i>Osorius</i>, and adds this
  note:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"All the editions have <i>Osorius</i>, which, however, must be a mere
  misprint. He was not a Portuguese, but a Spaniard, born at Tarragona, nor
  indeed ever a bishop. He was sent by St. Augustine on a mission to
  Jerusalem, and is supposed to have died in Africa in the earlier part of
  the fifth century."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The text of Bacon is quite right. The allusion is not to Paulus
  Orosius, a Spaniard, who flourished at the beginning of the fifth
  century; but to Jerome Osorio, who was born at Lisbon in 1506, afterwards
  became Bishop of Silves, and died in 1580. His works were published at
  Rome in 1592, in 4 vols. folio. His principal work, <i>De rebus Emanuelis
  Virtute et Auspicio gestis</i>, which first appeared in 1571, was several
  times reprinted, and was translated into French and English. <!-- Page
  494 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page494"></a>{494}</span></p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>P. 31. "Time, which is the author of authors."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>In <i>Nov. Org.</i>, i. 84., Time is called "Auctor auctorum, atque
  adeo omnis auctoritatis."</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>P. 34. "But of these conceits Aristotle speaketh seriously and wisely,
  when he saith, 'Qui respiciunt ad pauca de facili pronunciant."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The editor does not attempt to trace this passage. Query, If it is not
  in Aristotle, where is it to be found?</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>P. 60. "Ulysses, 'Qui vetulam prætulit immortalitati' is a figure of
  those which prefer custom and habit before all excellency."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The editor refers to <i>Cic. de Orat.</i>, i. 44., where it is said
  that such is the love of country,</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"Ut Ithacam illam, in asperrimis saxulis, tanquam nidulum, affixam,
  sapientissimus vir immortalitati anteponeret."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Another application of the saying is made by Bacon in his Essay VIII.,
  "On Marriage and Single Life:"</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"Grave natures, led by custom, and therefore constant, are commonly
  loving husbands, as was said of Ulysses, 'vetulam suam prætulit
  immortalitati.'"</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The passage in Cicero does not agree with the dictum quoted by Bacon,
  which seems to be a reference to the <i>Odyssey</i>, v. 136. 208-10.</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>P. 62. "Claudus in vià antevertit cursorem extra viam."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The same proverb is quoted in <i>Nov. Org.</i>, i. 61.</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>P. 85. "Omnia mutantur, nil interit"&mdash;</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>from Ovid, <i>Met.</i>, xv. 165.</p>

  <p>Several passages are cited by Bacon from Seneca, which the editor does
  not trace. Thus, in p. 146., it is said,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"Nocet illis eloquentia, quibus non rerum cupiditatem facit, sed
  sui."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Page 147.,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"Vere magnum habere fragilitatem hominis, securitatem Dei."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The same passage is also quoted by Bacon in Essay V., "On Adversity,"
  and in the treatise <i>De Sap. Vet.</i>, vol. x. p. 343., edit.
  Montagu.</p>

  <p>Again, p. 159.:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"De partibus vitæ quisque deliberat, de summâ nemo."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Page 152.,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"Cogita quamdiu eadem feceris," &amp;c.,</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>repeated in part in the "Essay on Death."</p>

  <p>This last passage is taken, with considerable verbal variations, from
  Epist. 77. § 6.</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"Therefore Aristotle, when he thinks to tax Democritus, doth in truth
  commend him, where he saith, <i>If we shall indeed dispute, and not
  follow after similitudes</i>," &amp;c.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The passage referred to is in <i>Eth. Nic.</i>, vi. 3.; but it
  contains no allusion to Democritus, who is not even named in the
  <i>Ethics</i>; and the word which Bacon renders <i>dispute</i> (<span
  title="akribologeisthai" class="grk"
  >&#x1F00;&kappa;&rho;&iota;&beta;&omicron;&lambda;&omicron;&gamma;&epsilon;&#x1FD6;&sigma;&theta;&alpha;&iota;</span>)
  means <i>to speak with precision</i>.</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>P. 163. "For as the ancient politiques in popular states were wont to
  compare the people to the sea, and the orators to the winds."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The allusion is to a couplet of Solon:</p>

  <div class="poem">

  <p>Page 177., the sayings, "Faber quisque fortunæ propriæ" is cited; and
  again, p. 178., "Faber quisque fortunæ suæ." In Essay XL., "On Fortune,"
  it is quoted, with the addition, "saith the poet." The words are to be
  found in Sallust, <i>Ad Cæsar. de Rep. Ord.</i>, ii. 1.:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"Sed res docuit, id verum esse, quad in carminibus Appius ait, fabrum
  suæ esse quemque fortunæ."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The Appius alluded to is Appius Claudius the Censor.</p>

  <p>Bacon proceeds to say:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"This conceit or position [viz. 'Faber quisque,' &amp;c.], if it be
  too much declared and professed, hath been thought a thing impolitic and
  unlucky, as was observed in Timotheus the Athenian, who, having done many
  great services to the estate in his government, and giving an account
  thereof to the people, as the manner was, did conclude every particular
  with this clause, 'And in this Fortune had no part.' And it came so to
  pass, that he never prospered in anything he took in hand
  afterwards."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The anecdote is as follows:&mdash;Timotheus had been ridiculed by the
  comic poets, on account of the small share which his own management had
  had in his successes. A satirical painting had likewise been made, in
  which he was represented sleeping, while Fortune stood over him, and drew
  the cities into his net. (See Plutarch, <i>Reg. et Imp. Apophth.</i>,
  vol. ii. p. 42., ed. Tauchnitz; Ælian, V.&nbsp;H. xiii. 42.) On one occasion,
  however, having returned from a successful expedition, he remarked to the
  Athenians, in allusion to the previous sarcasms, that in this campaign at
  least Fortune had no share. Plutarch, who relates the latter <!-- Page
  495 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page495"></a>{495}</span> anecdote
  in his <i>Life of Sylla</i>, c. 6., proceeds to say, that this boast gave
  so much offence to the deity, that he never afterwards prospered in any
  of his enterprises. His reverse of luck, in consequence of his
  vainglorious language against Fortune, is also alluded to by Dio
  Chrysost. <i>Orat.</i>, lxiv. § 19., edit. Emper. It will be observed
  that Plutarch refers the saying of Timotheus to a single expedition;
  whereas Bacon multiplies it, by extending it over a series of acts.</p>

  together with hearty goodwill, and a sort of good-humoured rivalry.... It
  is only when working by contract, however, that the Cashmeree displays
  his full physical powers, and it is then perfectly refreshing, in such a

  this, to observe him.... And then to see him carry a burden! On his head?
  No. On his back? Yes, but after a fashion of his own, perfectly natural
  and entirely independent of basket, or receptacle of any kind in which to
  place it. I have now in my garden some half-dozen of these labourers at
  work, removing immense masses of clay, which are nearly as hard as flint,
  and how do they manage? My friend Jumah Khan reverts his arms, and
  clasping his hands together behind his back, receives the pyramidal load,
  which generally overtops his head, and thus he conveys it to its

<h3>HOVEDEN'S ANNALS&mdash;BOHN'S "ANTIQUARIAN
LIBRARY."</h3>

  <p>Considering the cheap issue of all standard works of reference a great
  boon to the general student, I was predisposed to welcome heartily Mr.
  Bohn's <i>Antiquarian Library</i>. If, however, <i>cheapness</i> be
  accompanied by <i>incorrectness</i>, the promised boon I conceive to be
  worthless; even one or two glaring errors rendering the student
  distrustful of the entire series. I was led to form the first of these
  conclusions on receiving vol. i. of a translation of the <i>Annals of
  Roger de Hoveden</i>, by Henry T. Riley, Esq., barrister-at-law; who
  introduces the work by a flourish of trumpets in the Preface, on the
  multifarious errors of the London and Frankfort editions, and the labour
  taken to correct <i>his own</i>; to the second by observing, whilst
  cutting the leaves, the following glaring errors, put forward too as
  <i>corrections</i>:&mdash;Vol. i. p. 350., Henry II. is stated by the
  <i>Annalist</i> to have landed in Ireland, <span class="scac">A.D.</span>
  1172, "at a place which is called <i>Croch</i>, distant <i>eight
  miles</i> from the city of Waterford." Here Mr. Riley, with perfect
  gravity, suggests <i>Cork</i><a name="footnotetag1"
  href="#footnote1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> as the true reading!! Can it be,
  that a barrister-at-law, with an ominously Irish-sounding name, is
  ignorant that the city of Cork is somewhat more distant than <i>eight
  miles</i> from the <i>urbs intacta</i>, as Waterford loves to call
  herself? The fact is, however, that Hoveden and his former editors were
  nearly correct: on <!-- Page 496 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page496"></a>{496}</span> old maps of the harbour of Waterford,
  Crook Castle is laid down inside Creden Head, on the Waterford side of
  the harbour; and Crook is still the name of a place at the point
  indicated, somewhat more however than eight miles from Waterford.</p>

  <p>Again, at p. 351. occurs Hoveden's well-known and valuable enumeration
  of the Irish episcopal sees at the same period, of which Mr. Riley
  observes: "Nearly all these are mis-spelt ... they are in a state of
  almost hopeless confusion." And then, to make confusion worse confounded,
  his note on the Bishop of Ossory (p. 352.) says "In the text,
  'Erupolensis' is perhaps a mistake for 'Ossoriensis.'" Now,
  <i>Erupolensis</i> happens to be a correct <i>alias</i> of Ossoriensis:
  the former characterising the diocese from Kilkenny, the cathedral city,
  which being seated on the Nore, or Neor&mdash;Hibernicè <i>Eoir</i>,
  Latinè <i>Erus</i>, was sometimes called Erupolis&mdash;the latter from
  the territory with which the see was and is co-extensive, the ancient
  kingdom of Ossory.</p>

  <p>How many more errors there may be in the first volume of the work, I
  cannot say: but, at all events, what the reader has to complain of is,
  <i>not</i> that the translator was unable to tell all about "Croch" and
  "Erupolis," but that, not knowing, he has made matters worse by his hardy
  elucidations. Truly, at this rate, it were better that no cheap edition
  of Hoveden were vouchsafed to the public.</p>

  applicant's inability to work was owing to depressed spirits, produced by
  the flight of a croaking raven over her dwelling on the morning of his
  visit to the village. The pauper was by this circumstance, in connexion
  with its well-known ominous character, actually frightened into a state

<h3>SHAKSPEARE READINGS, NO. VII.</h3>

  <p>"What are 'Aristotle's checks?'"</p>

  <p>This is the question that <span class="sc">Mr. Collier</span> proposed
  in support of the alteration of <i>checks</i> into <i>ethics</i>, at p.
  144. of his <i>Notes and Emendations</i>. He terms <i>checks</i> "an
  absurd blunder," and in the preface he again introduces it, passing upon
  it the same unqualified sentence of excommunication, as upon "bosom
  multiplied," viz. "it can never be repeated." In this opinion he is
  backed by most of the public scribes of the day, especially by the critic
  of the <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i> for April, who declares "we should be
  very sorry to have to discover what the editors have understood by the
  <i>checks</i> of Aristotle." Furthermore, this critic thinks that "it is
  extremely singular that the mistake should have remained so long
  uncorrected;" and he intimates that they who have found any meaning in
  <i>checks</i>, have done so only because, through ignorance, they could
  find no meaning in <i>ethics</i>.</p>

  <p>Hence it becomes necessary for those who do find a meaning in
  <i>checks</i>, to defend that meaning; and hence I undertake to answer
  <span class="sc">Mr. Collier's</span> question.</p>

  <p>Aristotle's <i>checks</i> are those <i>moral adjustments</i> that form
  the distinguishing feature of his philosophy.</p>

  <p>They are <i>the eyes of reason</i>, whereby he would teach man to
  avoid divergence from the straight path of happiness.</p>

  <p>They are his moderators, his mediocrities, his metriopathics.</p>

  <p>They are his philosophical steering-marks, his moral guiding-lines,
  whereby the passions are to be kept in the <i>via media</i>; as much
  removed from total abnegation on the one hand, as from immoderate
  indulgence on the other.</p>

  <p>Virtue, according to Aristotle, consists in checked or <i>adjusted</i>
  propensities. Our passions are not in themselves evil, except when
  unchecked by reason. And inasmuch as we may overeat, or underfeed
  ourselves (the check being temperance), so may we suffer our other
  propensities to deviate from the <i>juste milieu</i>, either in the
  direction of indulgence or of privation. <!-- Page 497 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page497"></a>{497}</span></p>

  <p>The art of adjusting the passions requires an apprenticeship to
  virtue. The end to be attained is the establishment of good habits. These
  good habits, like any other skill, can only be attained by practice.
  Therefore the practice of virtue is the education of the passions.</p>

  <p><i>Ethics</i> is the doctrine of <i>habits</i>; but habits may be good
  or bad. When good, they constitute virtue; when bad, licentiousness.</p>

  <p>The doctrine of <i>checks</i> is that branch of <i>ethics</i> which
  teaches moral adjustment and restraint.</p>

  <p>Therefore <i>checks</i> and <i>licentiousness</i> are in better
  antithesis to each other, than <i>ethics</i> can be to either, because
  ethics includes both.</p>

  <p>The Aristotelian idea of <i>adjustment</i>, rather than <i>denial</i>,
  of the passions, is well illustrated in the following passage from
  Plutarch's <i>Morall Vertue</i>, by Philemon Holland, a contemporary of
  Shakspeare:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"For neither do they shed and spill the wine upon the floure who are
  afraide to be drunke, but delay the same with water: nor those who feare
  the violence of a passion, do take it quite away, but rather temper and
  qualifie the same: like as folke use to breake horses and oxen from their
  flinging out with their heeles, their stiffenes and curstnes of the head,
  and stubburnes in receiving the bridle or the yoke, but do not restraine
  them of other motions of going about their worke and doing their deede.
  And even so, verily, reason maketh good use of these passions, when they
  be well tamed, and, as it were, brought to hand: without overweakening or
  rooting out cleane that parte of the soule which is made for to second
  reason and do it good service.... Whereas let passions be rid cleane away
  (if that were possible to be done), our reason will be found in many
  things more dull and idle: like as the pilot and master of a ship hath
  little to do if the winde be laid and no gale at all stirring ... as if
  to <i>the discourse of reason</i> the gods had adjoined passion as a
  pricke to incite, and a chariot to set it forward."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Again, in describing the "Meanes," he says&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"Now to begin with Fortitude, they say it is the meane between
  Cowardise and rash Audacitie; of which twaine the one is a defect, the
  other an excesse of the yrefull passion: Liberalitie, betweene Nigardise
  and Prodigalitie: Clemencie and Mildnesse, betweene senselesse Indolence
  and Crueltie: Justice, the meane of giving more or lesse than due:
  Temperance, a mediocritie betweene the blockish stupiditie of the minde,
  moved with <i>no touch of pleasure</i>, and all unbrideled loosenes,
  whereby it is abandoned to all sensualitie."&mdash; <i>The Philosophie of
  Plutarch</i>, fol. 1603.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>It really does appear to me that there could not be a happier or more
  appropriate designation, for a philosophy made up in this way of "meanes"
  and adjustments, so as to steer between the <i>plus</i> and <i>minus</i>,
  than a system of <i>checks</i>&mdash;not fixed, or rigid rules, as they
  are sometimes interpreted to be, but nice allowances of excess or defect,
  to be discovered, weighed, and determined by individual reason, in the
  audit of each man's conscience, according to the strength or weakness of
  the passions he may have to regulate.</p>

  <p>I therefore oppose the substitution of <i>ethics</i>&mdash;</p>

  <p>1. Because we have the <i>primâ facie</i> evidence of the text itself,
  that <i>checks</i> was Shakspeare's word.</p>

  <p>2. Because we have internal evidence, in the significance and
  excellence of the phrase, that it was Shakspeare's word.</p>

  <p><i>Ethics</i> was the patent title by which Aristotle's moral
  philosophy was universally known; therefore any ignoramus, who never
  dipped beyond the title, might, <i>and would</i>, have used it. But no
  person, except one well read in the philosophy itself, would think of
  giving it such a designation as <i>checks</i>; which word, nevertheless,
  is most happily characteristic of it.</p>

  <p>3. Because, as before stated, Aristotle's <i>checks</i>, being the
  restrictive and regulating portion of Aristotle's <i>Ethics</i>, is
  necessarily a more diametrical antithesis to Ovid (and his
  <i>laxities</i>).</p>

  <p>4. Because I look upon the use of this phrase as one of those nice and
  scarcely perceptible touches by which Shakspeare was content rather to
  hint at, than to disclose his knowledge,&mdash;one of those effects
  whereby he makes a single word supply the place of a treatise.</p>

  <p>With these opinions, I cannot but look upon this threatened change of
  <i>checks</i> into <i>ethics</i>, as wholly unwarrantable, and I now
  protest against it as earnestly as, upon a former occasion, I did against
  the alteration of <i>sickles</i> into <i>shekels</i>, or, still worse,
  into <i>cycles</i> or into <i>circles</i>. It is with great satisfaction
  I compare four different views taken of this word by <span class="sc">Mr.
  Collier</span>, viz.&mdash;in the note to the text of his octavo edition
  of Shakspeare;&mdash;in an additional note in vol. i., page cclxxxiv. of
  that edition;&mdash;in the first announcement of his annotated folio in
  the <i>Athenæum</i> newspaper, Jan. 31st, 1852,&mdash;and finally (after
  my remarks upon the word in "N. &amp; Q."), his virtual reinstatement of
  the original <i>sickle</i> (till then supposed a palpable and undeniable
  misprint) at page 46. of <i>Notes and Emendations</i>, together with the
  production, <i>suo motu</i>, of an independent reference in support of my
  position.</p>

  <p>To return to this present substitution of <i>ethics</i> for
  <i>checks</i>, a very singular circumstance connected with it is the
  ignoring, by both <span class="sc">Mr. Collier</span> and by the critic
  in the <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i>, of Sir William Blackstone's original
  claim to the suggestion, by prior publication of upwards of half a
  century. At that time, notwithstanding the great learning and acuteness
  of the proposer, the alteration was rejected! And shall we now be less
  wise than our fathers? Shall we&mdash;misled by the prestige of a few
  drops of rusty ink fashioned into letters of formal cut&mdash;place
  implicit credence in emendations whose only claim to faith, like that of
  the Mormon scriptures, is that nobody knows whence they came? <!-- Page
  498 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page498"></a>{498}</span></p>

  <p>In the passage I have quoted from Philemon Holland, there may be
  observed two peculiarities which are generally supposed to be exclusively
  Shakspearian: one is the beautiful application of the word
  "touch"&mdash;the other the phrase "discourse of reason." Where this last
  expression occurs in <i>Hamlet</i>, it narrowly escaped <i>emendation</i>
  at the hands of Gifford! (See Mr. Knight's note, in his illustrated
  edition of <i>Shakspeare</i>.) It is the true Aristotelian <span
  title="dianoia" class="grk"
  >&delta;&iota;&#x1F71;&nu;&omicron;&iota;&alpha;</span>.</p>

  <p>There is also a third peculiarity of expression in the same quotation,
  in the use of the word <i>delay</i> in the sense of <i>diluere</i>, to
  dilute, temper, allay. There are at least two passages in Shakspeare's
  plays where the word is used in this sense, but which appear to have been
  overlooked by his glossarists. The first is in <i>All's Well that Ends
  Well</i>, Act IV. Sc. 3., where the French locals are moralising upon
  Bertram's profligate pursuit of Diana:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"Now God <i>delay</i> our rebellion&mdash;as we are ourselves, what
  are we?"</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The second is in <i>Cymbeline</i>, Act V. Sc. 4., where Jupiter
  tempers his love with crosses, in order to make his gifts&mdash;</p>

  <p><i>Portrait of Luther.</i>&mdash;A portrait of Luther, perhaps
  original, certainly nearly cotemporary with the Reformer, possessing many
  excellent qualities, was some time since shown me. It is in the
  possession of Mr. Horne, of Morton in Marsh, Gloucestershire: it was
  received by him from an elderly gentleman still living in London, who
  purchased it many years since at a sale of pictures. The picture is very
  dark, on canvass, with a black frame having a narrow gilt moulding. As
  the existence of this portrait is perhaps not known, mention of the fact
  might interest some of your readers. The picture, including frame, is
  perhaps in size thirty inches by twenty-four; and the age of the sitter,
  whose features are delineated with remarkable effects is probably under
  fifty years.</p>

  <p><i>Crassus' Saying.</i>&mdash;I find in the Diary of the poet Moore
  (in Lord John Russell's edition), vol. ii. p. 148., a conversation
  recorded with Dr. Parr, in which the Doctor quotes "the witticism that
  made Crassus laugh (the only time in his life): 'Similes habent labra
  lactucas.'"</p>

  <p>It appears (see the quotations in Facciolati) that this sage and
  laughter-moving remark of Crassus was made on seeing an ass eating a
  thistle; whereon he exclaimed, "Similes habent labra lactucas."</p>

  <p>In Bailey's edition of Facciolati it is said, "Proverbium habet locum
  ubi similia similibus contingunt,... quo sensu Angli dicimus, 'Like lips
  like lettuce: like priest like people.'"</p>

  <p>Out of this explanation it is difficult to elicit any sense, much less
  any "witticism."</p>

  <p>I suggest that Crassus' saying meant, "His (the ass's) lips hold
  thistles and lettuces to be both alike;" wanting the discrimination to
  distinguish between them. Or, if I may put it into a doggerel rhyme:</p>

<h2>Queries.</h2>

<h3>BEES AND THE SPHYNX ATROPOS.</h3>

  <p>Huber, in his <i>Observations on the Natural History of Bees</i>,
  avers that the moth called the <i>Sphynx atropos</i> invades and plunders
  with impunity a hive containing thousands of bees, notwithstanding the
  watchfulness, pugnacity, and formidable weapons of those insects. To
  account for this phenomenon, he states that the queen bee has the faculty
  of emitting a certain sound which instantly strikes the bees motionless;
  and he conjectures that this burglarious moth, being endowed with the
  same property, uses it to produce a similar effect, first on the
  sentinels at the entrance of the hive, and then on the bees within.</p>

  <p>In another part of his book (2nd edit. 1808, p. 202.) he relates what
  he himself witnessed on introducing a strange queen into a hive. The
  bees, greatly irritated, pulled her, bit her, and chased her away; but on
  her emitting the sound and assuming an extraordinary attitude, "the bees
  all hung down their heads and remained motionless." On the following day
  he repeated the experiment, and the intrusive queen was similarly
  maltreated; but when she emitted her sound, and assumed the attitude,
  from that moment the bees again became motionless.</p>

  <p>Have more modern observers verified this curious fact? Is it not a
  case of mesmerism?</p>

<h3>"THE CRAFTSMAN'S APOLOGY."</h3>

  <p>When Bolingbroke published his <i>Final Answer to the Remarks on the
  Craftsman's Vindication, and to all the Libels which have come, or may
  come from the same quarter against the Person last mentioned in the
  Craftsman of the 22nd May, 1731</i>, he was answered in five Poetical
  Letters to the King, which in keenness of wit, polished satire, and
  flowing ease of versification, have not been since surpassed. The title
  of the tract in which they are contained is <i>The Craftsman's Apology,
  being a Vindication of his Conduct and Writings in several Letters to the
  King</i>, printed for T. Cooper, 1732, 8vo. pages 32. By whom were these
  very clever and amusing letters written? Lord Hervey or Sir Charles
  Hanbury Williams are the parties one would think most likely to have
  written them; but they do not appear in the list of Lord Hervey's works
  given by Walpole, or amongst those noticed by Mr. Croker, or in Sir C.&nbsp;H.
  Williams's <i>Collected Works</i>, in three volumes. Independently of
  which, I question whether the versification is not, in point of harmony,
  too equal for either of them. If they be included in the collected works
  of any other writer of the time, which I have no immediate recollection
  of, some of your correspondents will no doubt be able to point him out.
  Should it appear that they have not been reprinted, I shall be disposed
  to recur again to the subject, and to give an extract from them, as, of
  all the attacks ever made upon Bolingbroke, they seem to me the most
  pleasant, witty, and effective.</p>

<h3>PALISSY AND CARDINAL WISEMAN.</h3>

  <p>On April 28, Cardinal Wiseman, at the Manchester Corn Exchange,
  delivered a lecture "On the Relation of the Arts of Design to the Arts of
  Production." It occupies thirteen columns of <i>The Tablet</i> of May 7,
  which professes to give it "from <i>The Manchester Examiner</i>, with
  corrections and additions." I have read it with pleasure, and shall
  preserve it as one of the best discourses on Art ever delivered; but
  there is a matter of fact, on which I am not so well satisfied. In
  noticing Bernard Palissy, the cardinal is reported to have said:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"For sixteen years he persevered in this way; and then was crowned with
  success, and produced the first specimens of coloured and beautiful
  pottery, such as are to this day sought by the curious; and <i>he
  received a situation in the king's household, and ended his days in
  comfort and respectability</i>."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>In the review of "Morley's Life of Palissy the Potter,"
  <i>Spectator</i>, Oct. 9, 1852, it is said:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"The period of the great potter's birth is uncertain. Mr. Morley fixes
  it, on probable data, at 1509; but with a latitude of six years on either
  side. <i>Palissy died in 1589 in the Bastile, where he had been confined
  four years as a Hugenot; the king and his other friends could defer his
  trial, but dared not grant him liberty.</i>"</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>All the accounts which I have read agree with Mr. Morley and the
  <i>Spectator</i>. Are they or the cardinal right, supposing him to be
  correctly reported?</p>

  Geneva, a printed correspondence in Latin between Archbishop Cranmer and
  Calvin, in which the latter forewarned the former, that though he
  perfectly understood the meaning of the baptismal service, yet "the time
  would come when" it "would be misconceived, and received as implying that
  baptism absolutely conveyed regeneration;" and that Cranmer replied,
  "that it is not possible such a construction can be put upon the passage,
  the church having sufficiently explained her meaning in the Articles and
  elsewhere." I have heard that search was made for these documents by M.
  D'Aubigné and others, but without success; one of the reports being, that
  "the documents had been apparently <i>cut out</i>." Mr. Brock's
  informant, I hear, was a Rev. Marc De Joux, who afterwards became an

  <p><i>Prester John.</i>&mdash;I should be glad, through the medium of "N.

<div class="note">
  <p>[The history of Prester John, or of the individuals bearing that
  appellation, appears involved in considerable confusion and obscurity.
  Most of our Encyclopædias contain notices of this mysterious personage,
  especially Rees's, and Collier's <i>Great Historical Dictionary</i>. "The
  fame of <i>Prester</i> or <i>Presbyter</i> John," says Gibbon, "a khan,
  whose power was vainly magnified by the Nestorian missionaries, and who
  is said to have received at their hands the rite of baptism, and even of
  ordination, has long amused the credulity of Europe. In its long progress
  to Mosul, Jerusalem, Rome, &amp;c., the story of Prester John evaporated
  into a monstrous fable, of which some features have been borrowed from
  the Lama of Thibet (<i>Hist. Généaologique des Tartares</i>, part ii. p.
  42.; <i>Hist. de Gengiscan</i>, p. 31. &amp;c.), and were ignorantly
  transferred by the Portuguese to the emperor of Abyssinia (Ludolph.
  <i>Hist. Æthop. Comment.</i> l. ii. c. 1.). Yet is is probable that, in
  the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, Nestorian Christianity was
  professed in the horde of the Keraites."]</p>

<h3>ENGLISH COMEDIANS IN GERMANY.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. ii., pp. 184. 459.; Vol. iii., p. 21.; Vol. vii.,
pp. 114. 360.)</p>

  <p>In 1605 the English comedians first appeared in Prussia. In October
  they performed before the Duchess Maria Eleonora at Koningsberg, for
  which they were well paid; they then proceeded to Elbing, whence they
  were dismissed with twenty thalers, since they produced scandalous things
  ("weil sie schandbare Dinge fürgebracht"). In 1607, they were again sent
  away, after they had performed the preceding year at Rostock. Some time
  after, the Elector of Brandenburg, Joh. Sigismund, employed a certain
  noble, Hans von Stockfisch, to obtain a theatrical company from England
  and the Netherlands. A troop of nineteen comedians, under the direction
  of John Spencer, came with sixteen musicians to add lustre to the
  electoral feasts. In 1611, they received 720 marks, as well as many
  hundred ells of various stuffs for costumes and decorations; of which
  great quantities were used in 1612. Many a time was it necessary to
  ransom them at great cost from inns and lodging-houses; so that the
  prince, in 1613, resolved to rid himself of these dear guests, and gave
  them a recommendation to the Elector of Saxony. In 1616 we find them in
  Dantzic, where they gave eight representations; and two years later, the
  Electress of Brandenburg, through Hans von Stockfisch, procured eighteen
  comedians, who performed at Elbing, Koningsberg, and other places, and
  were paid for their trouble ("für ihre gehabte Mühe eins für alles") 200
  Polish guilders.</p>

  <p>In 1639, English comedians are again found in Koningsberg; and, for
  the last time, in 1650, at Vienna, where William Roe, John Waide, Gideon,
  Gellius, and Robert Casse, obtained a license from Ferdinand I.</p>

  <p>In 1620 appeared a volume of <i>Englische Comedien und Tragedien,
  &amp;c.</i> (2nd edit., 1624), which was followed by a second; and in
  1670 by a third: in which last, however, the English element is not so
  prominent.</p>

  <p>These statements of Dr. Hagen are confirmed by numerous quotations
  from original documents, published by him in the <i>Neue Preuss.
  Provincial Blätter</i>, Koningsb., 1850, vol. x.; vid. et <i>Gesch. der
  Deuts. Schauspielk.</i>, by E. Devrient, Leipzic, 1848. Professor Hagen
  maintains, that in the beginning of the seventeenth century, the English
  comedies were performed in Dutch; and that, in Germany, the same persons
  were called indifferently English or Dutch comedians. They were
  Englishmen who had found shelter under the English trading companies in
  the Netherlands ("Es waren Engländer die in den englischen
  Handelscompagnien in den Niederlanden ein Unterkommen
  gefunden.")&mdash;From the <i>Navorscher</i>.</p>

<h3>A GENTLEMAN EXECUTED FOR WHIPPING A SLAVE
TO DEATH.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. vii., p. 107.)</p>

  <p>The occurrence noticed by W.&nbsp;W. is, I believe, the only instance on
  record in the West Indies of the <i>actual</i> execution of a gentleman
  for the murder, by whipping or otherwise, of a slave. Nor is this
  strange. In the days of slavery every owner of slaves was regarded in the
  light of a gentleman, and his "right to do what he liked with his own"
  was seldom called in question by judges or juries, who were themselves
  among the principal shareholders. The case of Hodge was, however, of an
  aggravated character. For the trivial offence of stealing a mango, he had
  caused one of his slaves to be whipped to death; and this was, perhaps,
  the least shocking of the repeated acts of cruelty which he was known to
  have committed upon the slaves of his estate.</p>

  <p>During slavery each colony had its Hodge, and some had more than one.
  The most conspicuous character of this kind in St. Lucia was <i>Jacques
  O'Neill de Tyrone</i>, a gentleman who belonged to an Irish family,
  originally settled in Martinique, and who boasted of his descent from one
  of the ancient kings of Ireland. This man had long been notorious for his
  cruelty to his slaves. At last, on the surrender of the colony to the
  British in 1803, the attention of the authorities was awakened; a charge
  of murder was brought against him, and he was sentenced to death. From
  this sentence he appealed to a higher court; but such was the state of
  public feeling at the bare idea of putting a white man to death for any
  offence against a slave, that for a long time the members of the court
  could not be induced to meet; and when they did meet, it was only to
  reverse the sentence of the court below. I have now before me the
  proceedings of both courts. <!-- Page 504 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page504"></a>{504}</span> The sentence of the inferior court,
  presided over by an European judge, is based upon the clearest evidence
  of O'Neill's having caused two of his slaves to be murdered in his
  presence, and their heads cut off and stuck upon poles as a warning to
  the others. The sentence of the Court of Appeal, presided over by a
  brother planter, and entirely composed of planters, reverses the
  sentence, without assigning any reason for its decision, beyond the mere
  allegations of the accused party. Such was criminal justice in the days
  of slavery!</p>

<h3>LONGEVITY.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. vii., p. 358., &amp;c.)</p>

  <p>On looking over some volumes of the <i>Annual Register</i>, from its
  commencement in 1758, I find instances of longevity very common, if we
  can credit its reports. In vol. iv., for the year 1761, amongst the
  deaths, of which there are many between 100 and 110, the following
  occur:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>January. "At Philadelphia, Mr. Charles Cottrell, aged 120 years; and
  three days after, his wife, aged 115. This couple lived together in the
  marriage state 98 years in great union and harmony."</p>

  <p>April. "Mrs. Gillam, of Aldersgate Street, aged 113."</p>

  <p>July. "John Newell, Esq., at Michael(s)town, Ireland, aged 127,
  grandson to old Parr, who died at the age of 152."</p>

  <p>August. "James Carlewhite, of Seatown, in Scotland, aged 111.</p>

  <p>"John Lyon, of Bandon, in the county of Cork, Ireland, aged 116."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>In September there are three aged 106; one 107; one 111; one 112; and
  one 114 registered. I will take three from the year 1768, viz.:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>January. "Died lately in the Isle of Sky, in Scotland, Mr. Donald
  M<sup>c</sup>Gregor, a farmer there, in the 117th year of his age.</p>

  <p>"Last week, died at Burythorpe, near Malton in Yorkshire, Francis
  Confit, aged 150 years: he was maintained by the parish above sixty
  years, and retained his senses to the very last."</p>

  <p>April. "Near Ennis, Joan M<sup>c</sup>Donough, aged 138 years."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Should sufficient interest attach to this subject, and any of the
  correspondents of "N. &amp; Q." wish it, I will be very happy to
  contribute my mite, and make out a list of all the deaths above 120
  years, or even 110, from the commencement of the <i>Annual Register</i>,
  but am afraid it will be found rather long.</p>

  <p>A few years ago there lived in New Ross, in the county of Wexford, two
  old men. The one, a slater named Furlong, a person of very intemperate
  habits, died an inmate of the poorhouse in his 101st year: he was able to
  take long walks up to a very short period before his death; and I have
  heard that he, his son, and grandson, have been all together on a roof
  slating at the same time. The other man was a nurseryman named Hayden,
  who died in his 108th year: his memory was very good as to events that
  happened in his youth, and his limbs, though shrunk up considerably,
  served him well. He was also in the frequent habit of taking long walks
  not long before his death.</p>

<h3>DERIVATION OF CANADA.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. vii., p. 380.)</p>

  <p>The derivation given in the "cutting from an old newspaper,"
  contributed by <span class="sc">Mr. Breen</span>, seems little better
  than that of Dr. Douglas, who derives the name from a <i>M. Cane</i>, to
  whom he attributes the honour of being the discoverer of the St.
  Lawrence.</p>

  <p>In the first place, the "cutting" is not correct, in so far as Gaspar
  Cortereal never ascended the river, having merely entered the gulf, to
  which the name of St. Lawrence was afterwards given by Jacques Carter.
  Neither was the main object of the expedition the discovery of a passage
  into the Indian Sea, but the discovery of gold; and it was the
  disappointment of the adventurers in not finding the precious metal which
  is supposed to have caused them to exclaim "Aca nada!" (Nothing
  here).</p>

  <p>The author of the <i>Conquest of Canada</i>, in the first chapter of
  that valuable work, says that "an ancient Castilian tradition existed,
  that the Spaniards visited these coasts before the French,"&mdash;to
  which tradition probably this supposititious derivation owes its
  origin.</p>

  <p>Hennepin, who likewise assigns to the Spaniards priority of discovery,
  asserts that they called the land <i>El Capo di Nada</i> (Cape Nothing)
  for the same reason.</p>

  <p>But the derivation given by Charlevoix, in his <i>Nouvelle France</i>,
  should set all doubt upon the point at rest; <i>Cannáda</i> signifying,
  in the Iroquois language, a number of huts (<i>un amas de cabanes</i>),
  or a village. The name came to be applied to the whole country in this
  manner:&mdash;The natives being asked what they called the first
  settlement at which Cartier and his companions arrived, answered,
  "Cannáda;" not meaning the particular appellation of the place, which was
  Stadacóna (the modern Quebec), but simply a village. In like manner, they
  applied the same word to Hochelága (Montreal) and to other places; whence
  the Europeans, hearing every locality designated by the same term,
  <i>Cannáda</i>, very naturally applied it to the entire valley of the St.
  Lawrence. It may not here be out of place to notice, that with respect to
  the derivation of <i>Quebec</i>, the weight of evidence <!-- Page 505
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page505"></a>{505}</span> would
  likewise seem to be favourable to an aboriginal source, as Champlain
  speaks of "la pointe de Québec, ainsi appellée des sauvages;" not
  satisfied with which, some writers assert that the far-famed city was
  named after Candebec, a town on the Seine; while others say that the
  Norman navigators, on perceiving the lofty headland, exclaimed "Quel
  bec!" of which they believe the present name to be a corruption.
  Dissenting from all other authorities upon the subject, Mr. Hawkins, the
  editor of a local guide-book called <i>The Picture of Quebec</i>, traces
  the name to an European source, which he considers to be conclusive,
  owing to the existence of a seal bearing date 7 Henry V. (1420), and on
  which the Earl of Suffolk is styled "Domine de Hamburg et de Québec."</p>

<h3>SETANTIORUM PORTUS.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. vii., pp. 180. 246.)</p>

  <p>Although the positions assigned by Camden to the ancient names of the
  various estuaries on the coasts of Lancashire and Cumberland are very
  much at variance with those laid down by more modern geographers; still,
  with regard to the particular locality assigned by him to the
  <i>Setantiorum Portus</i>, he has made a suggestion which seems worthy
  the attention of your able correspondent C.</p>

  <p>His position for <i>Morecambe Bay</i> is a small inlet to the south of
  the entrance of <i>Solway Firth</i>, into which the rivers <i>Waver</i>
  and <i>Wampool</i> empty themselves, and on which stands "the abbey of
  <i>Ulme</i>, or <i>Holme Cultraine</i>." He derives the name from the
  British, as signifying a "crooked sea," which doubtless is correct; we
  have <i>Môr taweh</i>, the main sea; <i>Morudd</i>, the Red Sea; and
  <i>Môr camm</i> may be supposed to indicate a bay much indented with
  inlets. It is needless to say that the present <i>Morecambe Bay</i>
  answers this description far more accurately than that in the Solway
  Firth. <i>Belisama Æstuarium</i> he assigns to the mouth of the Ribble,
  and is obliged to allot <i>Setantiorum Portus</i> to the remaining
  estuary, now called Morecambe Bay. However, he seems not quite satisfied
  with this last arrangement, and suggests that it would be more
  appropriate if we might read, as is found in some copies,
  <i>Setantiorum</i> <span title="limnê" class="grk"
  >&lambda;&#x1F77;&mu;&nu;&eta;</span>, instead of <span title="limên" class="grk"
  >&lambda;&iota;&mu;&#x1F74;&nu;</span>, thus assigning the name of
  Setantii to the inhabitants of the <i>lake district</i>.</p>

  <p>The old editions of Ptolemy, both Greek and Latin, are very incorrect,
  and, there is little doubt, have suffered from alterations and
  interpolations at the hands of ignorant persons. I have not access at
  present to any edition of his geography, either of Erasmus, Servetus, or
  Bertius, so I know not whether any weight should be allowed to the
  following circumstance; in the <i>Britannia Romana</i>, in Gibson's
  <i>Camden</i>, this is almost the only <i>Portus</i> to be found round
  the coast of England. The terms there used are (with one more exception)
  invariably <i>æstuarium</i>, or <i>fluvii ostium</i>. If this variation
  in the old reading be accepted, the appellation as given by Montanus,
  Bertius, and others, to <i>Winandermere</i>, becomes more
  intelligible.</p>

<h3>PHOTOGRAPHIC CORRESPONDENCE.</h3>

  <p><i>Stereoscopic Queries.</i>&mdash;Can any of your readers inform me
  what are the proper angles under which stereoscopic pictures should be
  taken?</p>

  <p>Mr. Beard, I am informed, takes his stereoscopic portraits at about
  6½°, or 1 in 9; that is to say, his cameras are placed 1 inch apart for
  every 9 inches the sitter is removed from them. The distance of the
  sitter with him is generally, I believe, 8 feet, which would give
  10&#x2154; inches for the extent of the separation between his cameras.
  More than this has the effect, he says, of making the pictures appear to
  stand out unnaturally; that is to say, if the cameras were to be placed
  12 inches apart (which would be equal to 1 in 8), the pictures would seem
  to be in greater relief than the objects.</p>

  <p>I find that the pictures on a French stereoscopic slide I have by me
  have been taken at an angle of 10°, or 1 in 6. This was evidently
  photographed at a considerable distance, the triumphal arch in the Place
  de Carousel (of which it is a representation) being reduced to about 1¼
  inch in height. How comes it then that the angle is here increased to 10°
  from 6½°, or to 1 in 6 from 1 in 9.</p>

  <p>Moreover, the only work I have been able to obtain on the mode of
  taking stereoscopic pictures, lays it down that all portraits, or near
  objects, should be taken under an angle of 15°, or, as it says, 1 in 5;
  that is, if the camera is 20 feet from the sitter, the distance between
  its first and second position (supposing only one to be used) should not
  exceed 4 feet: otherwise, adds the author, "the stereosity will appear
  unnaturally great."</p>

  <p>When two cameras are employed, the instructions proceed to state that
  the distance between them would be about 1/10th of the distance from the
  part of the object focussed. The example given is a group of portraits,
  and the angle, 1 in 10, is afterwards spoken of as being equivalent to an
  arc of 10°.</p>

  <p>Farther on, we are told that "the angle should be lessened as the
  distance between the nearest and farthest objects increase. Example: if
  the farthest object be twice as far from the camera as the near object,
  the angle should be 5° to a central point between these two.</p>

  <p>Now, I find by calculation that the measurements and the angle here
  mentioned by no means <!-- Page 506 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page506"></a>{506}</span> agree. For instance, an angle of 15° is
  spoken of as being equivalent to the measurement 1 in 5. An angle of 10°
  is said, or implied, to be the same as 1 in 10. This is far from being
  the fact. According to my calculations, the following are the real
  equivalents:&mdash;</p>

  <p>Will any of your readers oblige me by solving the above anomalies, and
  by giving the proper angles or measurement under which objects should be
  taken when near, moderately distant, or far removed from the camera;
  stating, at the same time, at how many feet from the camera an object is
  to be considered as near, or distant, or between the two? It would be a
  great assistance to beginners in the stereoscopic art, if some
  experienced gentleman would state the best distances and angles for
  taking busts, portraits, groups, buildings, and landscapes.</p>

  <p>It is said that stereoscopic pictures at great distances, such as
  views, should be taken "with a small aperture." But as the exact
  dimensions are not mentioned, it would be equally serviceable if, to the
  other details, were added some account of the dimensions of the apertures
  required for the several angles.</p>

  <p>In the directions given in the work from which I have quoted, it is
  said that when pictures are taken with one camera placed in different
  positions, the angle should be 15°; but when taken with two cameras, the
  angle should be 10°. Is this right? And, if so, why the difference?</p>

  <p>In the account given by you of Mr. Wilkinson's ingenious mode of
  levelling the cameras for stereoscopic pictures, it is said the
  plumb-line should be three feet long, and that the diagonal lines drawn
  on the ground glass should be made to cut the principal object focussed
  on the glass; and "when you have moved it, the camera, 8 <i>or</i> 10
  feet, make it cut the same object again." At what distance is the object
  presumed to be?</p>

  <p>Any information upon the above matters will be a great service, and
  consequently no slight favour conferred upon your constant reader since
  the photographic correspondence has been commenced.</p>

  <p><i>Photographic Portraits of Criminals, &amp;c.</i>&mdash;Such
  experience as I have had both in drawing portraits and taking
  photographs, impels me to hint to the authorities of Scotland Yard that
  they will by no means find taking the portraits of gentlemen that are
  "wanted" infallible, and I anticipate some unpleasant mistakes will ere
  long arise. I have observed that inability to recognize a portrait is as
  frequent in the case of photographs as on canvass, or in any other way. I
  defy the whole world of artists to reduce the why and wherefore into a
  reasonable shape; one will declare that "either" looks as if the
  individual was going to cry; the next critic will say he sees nothing but
  a pleasant smile. "I should never have known who it is if you hadn't told
  me," says a third; the next says "it's his eyes, but not his nose;" and
  perhaps the next will say, "it's his nose, but not his eyes."</p>

  <p>I was present not long since at the showing a portrait, which I think
  about the climax of doubt. "Not a bit like," was the first exclamation.
  The poor artist sank into his chair; after, however, a brief
  contemplation, "It's very like, <i>in-deed</i>; it's excellent:" this was
  said by a gentleman of the highest attainments, and one of the best poets
  of the day.</p>

  <p>Some persons (I beg pardon of the ladies) take the habiliments as the
  standard of recognition. I do not accuse them of doing it wilfully; they
  do not know it themselves. For example, Miss Smith will know Miss Jones a
  mile or so off. By her general air, or her face? Oh no! It's by the
  bonnet she helped her to choose at Madame What-d'ye-call's, because the
  colour suited he complexion.</p>

  <p>These are some of the mortifications attendant on artistic labour, and
  if they occur with the educated classes, they are more likely to happen
  even to "intelligent policemen," as the newspaper have it. If I dissent
  from the plan it is because I doubt its efficiency, but do not deny that
  it is worth a trial. If the French like to carry their portraits about
  with them on their passports to show to policemen, let them submit to the
  humiliation. I doubt very much whether the Chamber of Deputies would have
  made a law of it: it appears a new idea in jurisprudence that a man
  <i>must</i> sit for his picture. Any one, however, understanding the
  camera, would be alive before the removal of the cup of the lens, and be
  ready with a wry face; I do not suppose he could be imprisoned for
  <i>that</i>.</p>

  <p>Both plans are miserable travesties on the lovely uses of portrait
  painting and photography. Side by side with Cowper's passionate address
  to his mother's picture, how does it look?</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Oh, that those lips had language! Life has pass'd</p>
      <p>With me but roughly since I saw thee last."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>And,</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Blest be the art that can immortalise."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>If photography has an advantage over canvas, it does indeed
  immortalise (the painting may imitate, and the portrait may be good; but
  there is something more profoundly affecting in having the actual, the
  real shade of a friend perhaps long <!-- Page 507 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page507"></a>{507}</span> since in his grave);
  and we ought not only to be grateful to the illustrious inventors of the
  art, but prevent these base uses being made of it.</p>

  <p>In short, apart from the uncertainty of recognition, which I have not
  in the least caricatured, if Giles Scroggins, housebreaker and coiner,
  and all the swell mob, are to be photographed, it will bring the art into
  disgrace, and people's friends will inquire delicately where it was done,
  when they show their lively effigies. It may also mislead by a sharp
  rogue's adroitness; and I question very much its legality.</p>

  <p><i>Photography applied to Catalogues of Books.</i>&mdash;May not
  photography be usefully applied to the making of catalogues of large
  libraries? It would seem no difficult matter to obtain any number of
  photographs, of any required size, of the title-page of any book. Suppose
  the plan adopted, that five photographs of each were taken; they may be
  arranged in five catalogues, as follows:&mdash;Era, subject, country,
  author, title. These being arranged alphabetically, would form five
  catalogues of a library probably sufficient to meet the wants of all. Any
  number of additional divisions may be added. By adopting a fixed
  breadth&mdash;say three inches&mdash;for the photographs, to be pasted in
  double columns in folio, interchanges may take place of those unerring
  slips, and thus librarians aid each other. I throw out this crude idea,
  in the hope that photographers and librarians may combine to carry it
  out.</p>

  <p><i>Painter&mdash;Derrick</i> (Vol. vii., pp. 178. 391.).&mdash;I
  cannot agree with J.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C. that <i>painter</i> is a corruption of
  <i>punter</i>, from the Saxon <i>punt</i>, a boat. <!-- Page 508 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page508"></a>{508}</span> According to the
  construction and analogy of our language, a <i>punter</i> or
  <i>boater</i> would be the person who worked or managed the boat. I
  consider that <i>painter</i>&mdash;like <i>halter</i> and <i>tether</i>,
  derived from Gothic words signifying to <i>hold</i> and to
  <i>tie</i>&mdash;is a corruption of <i>bynder</i>, from the Saxon
  <i>bynd</i>, to bind. If the Anglo-Norman word <i>panter</i>, a snare for
  catching and holding birds, be a corruption of <i>bynder</i>, we are
  brought to the word at once. Or, indeed, we may go no farther back than
  <i>panter</i>.</p>

  <p>J. C. G. says that <i>derrick</i> is an ancient British word: perhaps
  he will be kind enough to let us know its signification. I always
  understood that a <i>derrick</i> took its name from <i>Derrick</i>, the
  notorious executioner at Tyburn, in the early part of the seventeenth
  century, whose name was long a general term for hangman. In merchant
  ships, the <i>derrick</i>, for hoisting up goods, is always placed at the
  hatchway, close by the <i>gallows</i>. The <i>derrick</i>, however, is
  not a nautical appliance alone; it has been long used to raise stones at
  buildings; but the crane, and that excellent invention the handy-paddy,
  has now almost put it out of employment. What will philologists, two or
  three centuries hence, make out of the word <i>handy-paddy</i>, which is
  universally used by workmen to designate the powerful winch, traversing
  on temporary rails, employed to raise heavy weights at large buildings.
  For the benefit of posterity, I may say that it is very <i>handy</i> for
  the masons, and almost invariably worked by Irishmen.</p>

  <p>As a collateral evidence to my opinion, that <i>painter</i> is derived
  from the Saxon <i>bynder</i>, through the Anglo-Norman <i>panter</i>, and
  that <i>derrick</i> is from <i>Derrick</i> the hangman, I may add that
  these words are unknown in the nautical technology of any other
  language.</p>

  <p><i>Pylades and Corinna</i> (Vol. vii., p. 305.).&mdash;If your

  with them, as must be evident to any one on the most cursory glance. The
  volumes contain memoirs of Mrs. Elizabeth Thomas, on whom Dryden
  conferred the poetical title of Corinna, and the letters which passed
  between her and Richard Gwinnett, her intended husband. A biography of
  this lady, neither whose life nor poetry were of the best, may be found
  in Chalmers's <i>Biog. Dict.</i>, vol. xxix. p. 281., and a farther one
  in Cibber's <i>Lives</i>, vol. iv. The <i>Dunciad</i>, and her part in
  the publication of Pope's early correspondence, have given her an unhappy
  notoriety. I must say, however, that, notwithstanding his provocation, I

  the reign of Henry VIII. From him descended the Lords Carrington of
  Wotton Waven, in Warwickshire, a title which became extinct in 1705.</p>

  <p>2. John Smith, who was also a Baron of the Exchequer in the reign of
  Anne. He became Chief Baron of the Exchequer in Scotland in 1708, and
  died in 1726. He endowed a hospital for poor widows at Frolesworth in
  Leicestershire.</p>

  <p>3. Sidney Stafford Smythe, likewise a Baron of the Exchequer under
  George II. and III., and Chief Baron in the latter reign. He was of the
  same family as that of the present Viscount Strangford.</p>

  <p>If Z. E. R. would be good enough to send a copy of the inscription on

  "curlews" themselves are the "dreary gleams:" the words are what the

  plain prose to be this: "The curlews are uttering their peculiar cry, as
  they fly over Locksley Hall, looking like (to me, the spectator) dreary
  gleams crossing the moorland."</p>

  <p>I could supply A. A. D. with several examples <i>in English</i>, from
  my commonplace-book, of the "bold figure of speech not uncommon in the

  <p><i>Lake of Geneva</i> (Vol. vii. p. 406.).&mdash;The account given in

  landslip in the valley of the <!-- Page 510 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page510"></a>{510}</span> Upper Rhone," is evidently that of a
  sudden <i>débâcle</i> destructive of life and property, but not such as
  to effect any permanent change in the configuration of the country. That
  an antiquary like Montfaucon should have fallen into the blunder of
  supposing that the Lacus Lemanus was then formed, may well excite
  surprise. The breadth of the new-formed lake, as given by Marius, is
  impossible, as the mountains in the valley are scarcely anywhere more
  than a mile apart. The valley of the Upper Rhone is liable to such
  <i>débâcles</i>, and one which would fill it might be called a lake,
  although of short duration. Having witnessed the effects of the
  <i>débâcle</i> of 1818 a few weeks after it happened, I can easily
  understand how such a one as that described by Marius should have
  produced the effects attributed to it, and yet have left no traces of its
  action after the lapse of centuries.</p>

  <p><i>Gloves at Fairs</i> (Vol. vii., p. 455.).&mdash;The custom of
  "hanging out the glove at fair time," as described by E.&nbsp;G.&nbsp;R., is, in
  all probability, of Chester origin. The annals of that city show that its
  two great annual fairs were established, or rather confirmed, by a
  charter of Hugh Lupus, the first Norman Earl of Chester, who granted to
  the abbot and convent of St. Werburgh (now the cathedral) "the
  extraordinary privilege, that no criminals resorting to their fairs at
  Chester should be arrested for any crime whatever, except such as they
  might have committed during their stay in the city." For several
  centuries, Chester was famous for the manufacture of gloves; and in token
  thereof, it was the custom for some days before, and during the
  continuance of the fair, to hang out from the town-hall, then situate at
  the High Cross, their local emblem of commerce&mdash;a <i>glove</i>:
  thereby proclaiming that non-freemen and strangers were permitted to
  trade within the city, a privilege at all other times enjoyed by the
  citizens only. During this period of temporary "free trade," debtors were
  safe from the tender mercies of their creditors, and free from the visits
  of the sheriff's officer and his satellites. On the removal of the
  town-hall to another part of the city, the leathern symbol of
  "unrestricted competition" was suspended, at the appointed season, from
  the roof of St. Peter's Church; until that reckless foe to antiquity, the
  Reform Bill, aimed a heavy blow at all our prescriptive rights and
  privileges, and decreed that the stranger should be henceforth on a
  footing with the freeborn citizen. Notwithstanding this, the authorities
  of the city still continued to "hang out their banner on the outward
  walls;" and it is only within the last ten years that the time-honoured
  custom has ceased to exist.</p>

  <p><i>Astronomical Query</i> (Vol. vii., p.84.).&mdash;Your fair
  correspondent <span class="sc">Leonora</span> makes a mistake in
  reference to the position, in regard to the zodiac, of the
  newly-discovered planets. It is indeed not at all surprising that these
  bodies were not discovered before, for this reason&mdash;they <i>do not
  move within the circle of the zodiac</i>: they lie far beyond it, so much
  so, that to include them the zodiac must be expanded to at least five
  times its present breadth. Hence they lie out of the path of ordinary
  observation, and their discovery is usually the result of keen telescopic
  examination of distant parts of the heavens. <span
  class="sc">Leonora</span> is of course aware, that, with the exception of
  Neptune (the discovery of which is a peculiar case), all the recently
  discovered planets belong to the cluster of asteroids which move between
  Mars and Jupiter. These are all invisible to the eye with the exception
  of Vesta, and she is not to be distinguished by any but an experienced
  star-gazer, and under most favourable circumstances; their minuteness,
  their <i>extra</i>-zodiacal position, and the outrageous orbits which
  they describe, all conspire to keep them out of human ken until they are
  detected by the telescope, and ascertained to be planets either by their
  optical appearances, or by a course of watching and comparison of their
  positions with catalogues of the fixed stars.</p>

  <p><i>Hallett and Dr. Saxby</i> (Vol. vii., p. 41.).&mdash;I know nothing
  of the parties, but have the book about which S.&nbsp;R. inquires. The title
  is not accurately given in the <i>Literary Journal</i>. Instead of "An
  Ode to Virtue," by Dr. Morris Saxby, it is <i>An Ode on Virtue by a Young
  Author, dedicated to Dr. William Saxby; with a Preface and Notes,
  Critical and Explanatory, by a Friend</i>&mdash;"Mens sibi conscia
  recti"&mdash;A good intention. Printed anno Domini <span
  class="scac">MDCCXCI</span>, pp. 16.</p>

  <p>A more stupid production could not easily be found; but, as it must be
  scarce, if the story about the destruction of all but eight copies is
  true, I transcribe a part of the dedication:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"Most August Doctor,</p>

  <p>"The reputation you have acquired by professional merit, with the
  respect which is universally shown to you on account of your practical
  observance of moral philosophy, has induced me to select you as a
  protector of the following work; which being evidently intended to
  promote a cause for which you was always a zealous advocate, I have
  nourished the most flattering hopes that you will be rather pleased than
  offended by this unwarrantable presumption.</p>

  <p>"It is necessary I should deviate from the general rule of celebrating
  a patron's virtues in a high strain of panegyric, being sensible how
  generally yours are known, and how justly admired."&mdash;P. 3.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The ode contains only ten lines:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Virtue, a mere chimera amongst the fair,</p>
      <p>Is now quite vanquished into air;</p>
      <p>Formerly it was thought a thing of worth,</p>
      <p>But now who thinks of such poor stuff.</p>
      <p>It's only put on to deceive,</p>
      <p>That us poor mortals on them may crave;</p>
      <p>Fall down and swear their beauty far</p>
      <p>Surpasses what are ever saw!</p>
      <p>Then they who think all's true that's said," &amp;c.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>I omit the final line as unseemly.</p>

  <p>Dr. Saxby is mentioned only on the title-page, and that part of the
  dedication which I have copied. He must have been a sensitive man to have
  felt such an attack, and a prompt one to settle his account with the
  author so quickly. As it is obvious that the ode was published solely to
  annoy him, we may be allowed to hope that in the "severe personal
  chastisement" he was not sparing of whipcord. The absence of place of
  publication and printer's name render inquiry difficult; and there is no
  indication as to whether Dr. Saxby was of Divinity, Law, or Physic.</p>

  <p>"George Castriot, Prince of Albania, one of the strongest and

  Mahomet the Turkish Emperor, his mortall enemy, desired to see. Castriot
  (surnamed of the Turks, Ischenderbeg, that is, Great Alexander, because
  of his valiantnesse), having received a pledge for the restitution of his
  cimeter, sent it so far as Constantinople to Mahomet, in whose court
  there was not any man found that could with any ease wield that piece of
  steele: so that Mahomet sending it back againe, enioyned the messenger to
  tell the prince, that in this action he kind proceeded enemy-like, and
  with a fraudulent mind, sending a counterfeit cimeter <!-- Page 512
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page512"></a>{512}</span> to make his
  enemie afraid. Ischenderbeg writ back to him, that he had simply without
  fraud or guile sent him his owne cimeter, with the which he used to helpe
  himselfe couragiously in the wars; but that he had not sent him the hand
  and the arme which with the cimeter cleft the Turkes in two, struck off
  their heads, shoulders, legs, and other parts, yea, sliced them of by the
  wast; and that verie shortly he would show him a fresh proofe thereof;
  which afterwards he performed."&mdash;<i>Historical Meditations from the

  <p>The following, relating to the arm and sword of Scanderbeg, may

<h3>NOTES ON BOOKS, ETC.</h3>

  <p>The success which has attended <i>The Chronological New Testament</i>
  has encouraged the publisher of that most useful work to undertake an
  edition of the entire Scriptures on a similar plan; and we have now
  before us the First Part of <i>The English Bible, containing the Old and
  New Testaments according to the authorised Version: newly divided into
  Paragraphs, with concise Introductions to the several Books; and with
  Maps and Notes illustrative of the Chronology, History, and Geography of
  the Holy Scriptures; containing also the most remarkable Variations of
  the ancient Versions, and the chief Results of modern Criticism</i>. Even
  this ample title-page does not, however, point out the many helps towards
  a better understanding of the Word of God, which, by improvements in its
  division and typographical arrangement, are here furnished for the use of
  the devout student: and which has this great recommendation in our eyes,
  as we have no doubt it will be its greatest in that of many of our
  readers, that it is no endeavour to furnish a new translation, but only
  an attempt to turn our noble authorised version to the best account. The
  present Part completes the Book of Genesis, and we have little doubt that
  its success will be such as to secure for the publisher that patronage
  which will enable him to complete so desirable a work as his "<i>New
  Edition of the authorised Version of the Bible</i>." While on this
  subject, we may fitly call attention to the eighth number of <i>The
  Museum of Classical Antiquities: a Quarterly Journal of Ancient Art</i>,
  and its accompanying <i>Supplement</i>, both of which are entirely
  occupied with a question which, from its connexion with our holiest and
  most religious feelings, must always command our deepest
  attention,&mdash;namely, the true site of Calvary, and of the Holy
  Sepulchre. The question is discussed at considerable length, and with
  great learning and acuteness; and, we trust, from its generally
  interesting character, may have the effect of drawing attention to a
  journal which deserves the patronage of scholars to a greater extent
  than, from the prefatory notice, it would appear to have received up to
  the present time.</p>

  <p>The Second Part of <i>The Ulster Journal of Archæology</i> has just
  appeared. We cannot better recommend it to our antiquarian friends than
  by pointing out that it contains the following papers:&mdash;1.
  Metropolitan Visitation of the Diocese of Derry, <span
  class="scac">A.D.</span> 1397. 2. Iona. 3. Anglo-Norman Families of
  Lecale, County Down. <!-- Page 514 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page514"></a>{514}</span> 4. Ogham Inscriptions. 5. Irish Surnames,
  their past and present Forms. 6. The Island of Tory in the Pagan Period.
  7. Origin and Characteristics of the People in the Counties of Down and
  Antrim. 8. King William's Progress to the Boyne. 9. Antiquarian Notes and
  Queries. 10. Annals of Ulster.</p>

  <p>We ought, in the same way, to specify the various papers to be found
  in the recently-published <i>Reports and Papers read at the Meetings of
  the Architectural Society of the Archdeaconry of Northampton and the
  Counties of York and Lincoln; and of the Architectural and Archæological
  Society of the County of Bedford during the Year 1852</i>,&mdash;but such
  a course is obviously impossible. There is one paper in the volume which,
  as especially worthy the attention of those interested in our
  Ecclesiastical History, deserves to be particularly noticed, namely, the
  Rev. G.&nbsp;A. Poole's <i>Synchronological Table of the Bishops of the
  English Sees from the Year 1050 to 1550</i>. How much good service might
  be done to Historical Literature by the compilation and printing of many
  documents of a similar character!</p>

  <p>"The narrative is of a truthful, matter-of-fact character. The writers
  tell us what they saw, with little if any colouring or exaggeration.
  Wherever there is any interest in the things themselves, it is preserved
  in the book, whether it relates to the appearance of the gold-diggings
  and the diggers or their mode of life&mdash;to the places frequently
  depopulated of <i>men</i> by the gold fever pervading the colonies, to
  the night bivouac of quiet people to avoid the close atmosphere and
  riotous companions at the roadside inns from the crowds rushing to or
  returning from the diggings, or to many other more permanent scenes of
  still or animated life. With the actual are mingled remarks on Australia,
  and advice to emigrants, the latter of which is of a judicious
  kind."&mdash;<i>Spectator.</i></p>

<h3>THE DIARY AND HOURES OF

<p class="cenhead">A FAYTHFULLE CHILDE, 1552.</p>

<p class="cenhead">Edited by the LADY CHARLOTTE PEPYS.</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"This work resembles several productions of the last few years. The
  Diary professes to be written by a noble young lady of the sixteenth
  century. 'Lady Adolie' has an advantage over most of its precursors in
  the greater depth and variety of the incidents. The Journal begins just
  before the accession of Bloody Mary, and ends with the martyrdom of the
  youthful writer at Smithfield.... The book is charmingly written; the
  kindly, simple, loving spirit of a girl in her teens, thrown much upon
  her own resources, is truthfully depicted, as well as the firm piety of
  that age."&mdash;<i>Spectator.</i></p>

  <p>"The familiar conversation of the day, as sought to be reproduced in
  this Diary, wears an appearance of singular truthfulness, and whether the
  topic be the deathbed of good King Edward, the merits of Somerset, Ladye
  Jane Grey, her Grace the Ladye Elysabeth, the Queen herself, or the
  demeanour of her Spanish husband, the proceedings of Cardinal Pole, the
  doings at the Tower prison, the volume reflects as in a faithful mirror
  the opinions current in the national mind."&mdash;<i>Globe.</i></p>

  <p>"What cordial admiration, what honest unaffected praise, have we to
  bestow on these etchings! Never did we see a more perfect harmony
  expressed throughout between accomplishment and grace of hand and moral
  beauty of mind. Not the most faultless of mere correctness of drawing
  could have the effect which these etchings produce. Within outlines
  imperfect as we have described them, often the most exalted fancies are
  found. The arrangement is almost always excellent&mdash;than the
  groupings of the figures, and the composition of each scene, nothing for
  the most part can be better. And the beautiful sympathy with children
  that is displayed, the enjoyment in their joy, their gay sports their
  tender little thoughtful gravities and their innocent purity of affection
  which brings round them the thoughts of angels&mdash;all this has most
  delightful expression in 'A Children's
  Summer.'"&mdash;<i>Examiner.</i></p>

  <p>"From time to time we have noticed the periodical appearances of this
  edition of the famous book of the Brothers Grimm, and have only now to
  mention the fact of its completion into two compact, well-filled volumes.
  The translation is done in just the simple, homely way which suits best
  with the stories.... Every juvenile library should possess this excellent
  'Grimm.'"&mdash;<i>Examiner.</i></p>

  <p>"The two volumes of 'Household Stories,' translated from the Messrs.
  Grimm, are the completed form of an edition which was issued in numbers,
  and which has from time to time been mentioned by us as in course of
  publication. What with Mr. Wehnert's admirable illustrations (of which
  the number is almost countless) and the general elegance of production,
  the work now presents an appearance sufficiently seductive to the
  juvenile class of readers, to whom it is more particularly
  addressed."&mdash;<i>Athenæum.</i></p>

  <p>"We cannot again avoid alluding to Mr. Wehnert's illustrations to
  'Grimm.' They are instinct with the most vital spirit of German legendary
  romance&mdash;remote, unreal, grotesque, and suggestive; with strange
  bits of landscape and beautiful human faces (those of the children
  remarkably so), and with a singular absence of strong contrast of light
  and shade, as though the sun which shone upon them was not the same which
  shines upon this earth."&mdash;<i>Athenæum</i>, second notice.</p>
